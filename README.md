# Airbnb New York City 2019


**Intro** <br>
This is a data visualization project about Airbnb New York in 2019. I made this application only to learn how to create dashboard visualizations using Shiny Dashboard at R Studio. The data that I used was downloaded from Kaggle: [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps). I have published this source on github, so feel free if you want to use it.
